# LEA

LEA is a 128-bit block cipher developed to provide confidentiality in high-speed environments such as big data and cloud computing, as well as lightweight environments such as IoT devices and mobile devices.

# Description

This project is to run LEA-128/196 on FPGA.
You can get the result of encryption/decryption by giving the key and plaintext/ciphertext.

# Requirements

- Xilinx PYNQ-Z1
- Vitis HLS 2020.2
- Vivado 2020.2
- Python 3.8.2
- pynqlinux v2.7
- Jupyter Notebook

# Install

- Download this repository
- Upload all the files under folder "LEA_files" to your PYNQ-Z1's jupyter notebook folder to implement this system
- Use jupyter notebook running on your PYNQ-Z1 and input key and plaintext/ciphertext, then execute.
